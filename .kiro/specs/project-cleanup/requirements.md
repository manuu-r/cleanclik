# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for a comprehensive project cleanup initiative focused on improving code maintainability, removing dead code, and optimizing the VibeSweep Flutter application. The cleanup will enhance code readability, reduce technical debt, and ensure the codebase follows established architectural patterns without changing core functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Dead Code Elimination

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove unused code and imports so that the codebase is cleaner and more maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the codebase THEN the system SHALL identify and remove all unused imports across all Dart files
2. WHEN scanning for dead code THEN the system SHALL identify and remove unused methods, classes, and variables that are not referenced anywhere
3. WHEN examining service files THEN the system SHALL remove any commented-out code blocks that are no longer needed
4. WHEN reviewing test files THEN the system SHALL remove any disabled or skipped tests that are no longer relevant
5. IF duplicate functionality exists THEN the system SHALL consolidate it into a single, well-documented implementation

### Requirement 2: Code Structure Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the code to follow consistent architectural patterns so that it's easier to understand and maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining service classes THEN each service SHALL have a single, well-defined responsibility
2. WHEN reviewing file organization THEN all files SHALL be placed in their correct directories according to the established architecture
3. WHEN analyzing dependencies THEN circular dependencies SHALL be identified and resolved
4. WHEN checking naming conventions THEN all classes, methods, and variables SHALL follow the established naming patterns
5. IF services have overlapping functionality THEN they SHALL be refactored to eliminate duplication while maintaining existing interfaces

### Requirement 3: Documentation and Comments Cleanup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear and accurate documentation so that I can understand the codebase quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing code comments THEN outdated or misleading comments SHALL be updated or removed
2. WHEN examining service classes THEN each public method SHALL have clear documentation describing its purpose and parameters
3. WHEN checking README files THEN they SHALL accurately reflect the current state of the code
4. WHEN reviewing inline comments THEN they SHALL add value and not state the obvious
5. IF documentation conflicts with implementation THEN the documentation SHALL be updated to match the actual behavior

### Requirement 4: Error Handling Standardization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent error handling patterns so that debugging and maintenance are easier.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining service methods THEN all async operations SHALL have proper error handling with specific exception types
2. WHEN reviewing resource management THEN all services with streams, timers, or controllers SHALL implement proper disposal methods
3. WHEN checking error logging THEN all services SHALL use the established logging service consistently
4. WHEN analyzing exception handling THEN generic catch blocks SHALL be replaced with specific exception handling where appropriate
5. IF memory leaks are possible THEN proper cleanup mechanisms SHALL be implemented

### Requirement 5: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the code to be optimized for performance so that the app runs smoothly on target devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing service initialization THEN unnecessary heavy operations SHALL be moved to lazy initialization
2. WHEN reviewing stream usage THEN unused stream subscriptions SHALL be properly cancelled
3. WHEN examining object creation THEN unnecessary object instantiation in loops SHALL be optimized
4. WHEN checking async operations THEN proper use of async/await patterns SHALL be ensured
5. IF performance bottlenecks exist THEN they SHALL be identified and optimized without changing functionality

### Requirement 6: Test Coverage and Quality

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive and meaningful tests so that I can refactor with confidence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing existing tests THEN they SHALL be updated to reflect any code changes made during cleanup
2. WHEN examining test structure THEN tests SHALL follow the established testing patterns and naming conventions
3. WHEN checking test coverage THEN critical service methods SHALL have corresponding unit tests
4. WHEN analyzing test quality THEN tests SHALL be meaningful and not just for coverage metrics
5. IF tests are flaky or unreliable THEN they SHALL be fixed or removed

### Requirement 7: Dependency Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean dependency management so that the project builds reliably and dependencies are up-to-date.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining pubspec.yaml THEN unused dependencies SHALL be removed
2. WHEN checking import statements THEN they SHALL use relative imports for internal files and package imports for external dependencies
3. WHEN reviewing dependency versions THEN they SHALL be compatible and up-to-date where possible
4. WHEN analyzing provider dependencies THEN they SHALL follow the established Riverpod patterns
5. IF dependency conflicts exist THEN they SHALL be resolved without breaking functionality

### Requirement 8: Code Formatting and Style

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent code formatting so that the codebase is professional and readable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running dart format THEN all Dart files SHALL be properly formatted
2. WHEN examining code style THEN it SHALL follow the established Dart style guide
3. WHEN reviewing line lengths THEN they SHALL be within reasonable limits for readability
4. WHEN checking indentation THEN it SHALL be consistent throughout the codebase
5. IF style violations exist THEN they SHALL be corrected automatically where possible
