# Implementation Plan

- [ ] 1. Analyze and remove unused imports
  - Scan all Dart files in lib/ directory for unused import statements
  - Remove unused imports while preserving necessary ones
  - Verify code still compiles after import cleanup
  - _Requirements: 1.1_

- [ ] 2. Identify and remove dead code
  - Find unused methods, classes, and variables across the codebase
  - Remove commented-out code blocks that are no longer needed
  - Preserve intentionally unused code (overrides, interfaces) with proper documentation
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3_

- [ ] 3. Standardize code formatting
  - Run dart format on all Dart files to ensure consistent formatting
  - Fix any style inconsistencies and line length issues
  - Ensure proper indentation and spacing throughout codebase
  - _Requirements: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5_

- [ ] 4. Clean up service architecture
  - Review services in lib/core/services/ for single responsibility violations
  - Consolidate duplicate functionality between similar services
  - Ensure proper file organization according to established architecture
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.5, 2.2_

- [ ] 5. Resolve dependency issues
  - Identify and resolve circular dependencies between services
  - Standardize import patterns (relative vs package imports)
  - Review pubspec.yaml for unused dependencies
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3_

- [ ] 6. Improve error handling consistency
  - Standardize error handling patterns across all services
  - Ensure proper resource disposal in services with streams/controllers
  - Add consistent logging using the established logging service
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [ ] 7. Optimize performance bottlenecks
  - Move heavy operations to lazy initialization where appropriate
  - Fix stream subscription leaks and ensure proper disposal
  - Optimize object creation in loops and performance-critical paths
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_

- [ ] 8. Update and clean documentation
  - Remove or update outdated comments that don't match current implementation
  - Ensure public methods have clear documentation
  - Update README files to reflect current codebase state
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 9. Enhance existing tests
  - Update tests to reflect any changes made during cleanup
  - Remove obsolete or disabled tests that are no longer relevant
  - Ensure tests follow established patterns and naming conventions
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.4_

- [ ] 10. Validate cleanup results
  - Run full test suite to ensure no functionality was broken
  - Verify app builds and runs correctly after all changes
  - Document all changes made and improvements achieved
  - _Requirements: 6.3, 6.5_
