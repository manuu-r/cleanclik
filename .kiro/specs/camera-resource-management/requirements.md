# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This spec addresses critical camera resource management issues in VibeSweep where the camera is not being properly passed between QR scanning mode and ML mode (object/hand detection). Users are experiencing crashes, frozen camera feeds, and mode switching failures when transitioning between these two camera-dependent features. The system needs robust camera resource management to ensure seamless transitions and prevent resource conflicts.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Implement Centralized Camera Resource Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want the camera to work reliably when switching between QR scanning and ML detection modes, so that I can use both features without app crashes or frozen camera feeds.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user switches from QR scanning mode to ML mode THEN the system SHALL properly release QR camera resources before initializing ML camera resources
2. WHEN the user switches from ML mode to QR scanning mode THEN the system SHALL properly dispose of ML camera resources before initializing QR camera resources
3. WHEN camera resource conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL detect and resolve them automatically without user intervention
4. WHEN multiple camera requests are made simultaneously THEN the system SHALL queue them and process them sequentially to prevent conflicts
5. WHEN camera initialization fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff and provide clear error feedback

### Requirement 2: Ensure Proper Camera State Synchronization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the camera to maintain consistent state when switching between modes, so that I don't experience frozen feeds or unresponsive camera controls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN switching between modes THEN the system SHALL maintain a single source of truth for camera state across all components
2. WHEN camera state changes THEN the system SHALL notify all dependent components immediately to prevent stale state
3. WHEN camera permissions change THEN the system SHALL update all camera-dependent features consistently
4. WHEN the app is backgrounded during camera use THEN the system SHALL properly pause camera resources and resume them when foregrounded
5. WHEN device orientation changes THEN the system SHALL maintain camera functionality across both QR and ML modes

### Requirement 3: Implement Robust Error Recovery and Fallback Mechanisms

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to recover gracefully from camera errors, so that I can continue using the app even when camera issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN camera initialization fails THEN the system SHALL provide alternative input methods where possible (manual entry for QR codes, photo upload for ML detection)
2. WHEN camera resources become unavailable THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with actionable recovery steps
3. WHEN camera permissions are revoked THEN the system SHALL guide users to re-enable permissions with clear instructions
4. WHEN camera hardware fails THEN the system SHALL disable camera-dependent features gracefully without crashing the app
5. WHEN network connectivity affects camera features THEN the system SHALL provide offline fallback options where applicable

### Requirement 4: Optimize Camera Performance and Resource Usage

**User Story:** As a user, I want camera operations to be fast and responsive, so that I can quickly scan QR codes and detect objects without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN switching between camera modes THEN the system SHALL complete the transition in less than 500ms on mid-range devices
2. WHEN camera is idle for more than 30 seconds THEN the system SHALL reduce resource usage while maintaining quick resume capability
3. WHEN multiple camera operations are queued THEN the system SHALL prioritize user-initiated actions over background processing
4. WHEN device memory is low THEN the system SHALL optimize camera buffer usage without compromising functionality
5. WHEN camera preview is not visible THEN the system SHALL pause unnecessary camera processing to conserve battery

### Requirement 5: Ensure Thread Safety and Concurrency Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want camera operations to be thread-safe, so that concurrent access doesn't cause race conditions or crashes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple components access camera resources simultaneously THEN the system SHALL use proper synchronization mechanisms to prevent race conditions
2. WHEN camera operations are performed on background threads THEN the system SHALL ensure UI updates occur on the main thread
3. WHEN camera disposal is in progress THEN the system SHALL prevent new camera initialization requests until disposal is complete
4. WHEN camera state is being modified THEN the system SHALL use atomic operations to prevent partial state updates
5. WHEN camera callbacks are triggered THEN the system SHALL handle them safely even if the calling component has been disposed
