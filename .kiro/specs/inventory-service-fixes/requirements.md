# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical issues with the current inventory service implementation, focusing on service renaming, data persistence, confirmation dialog functionality, and proper points allocation timing. The improvements will ensure a more reliable and user-friendly inventory management experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the ConsolidatedInventoryService renamed to InventoryService, so that the codebase has consistent and clear naming conventions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the service is referenced anywhere in the codebase THEN it SHALL be called InventoryService
2. WHEN imports reference the service THEN they SHALL use the correct InventoryService name
3. WHEN providers reference the service THEN they SHALL use the updated service name
4. WHEN tests reference the service THEN they SHALL use the InventoryService name

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want my inventory data to persist across app sessions, so that I don't lose my collected items when I close and reopen the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I add items to my inventory THEN the inventory data SHALL be immediately saved to local storage
2. WHEN I reopen the app THEN my previous inventory items SHALL be restored from local storage
3. WHEN the app starts THEN it SHALL load inventory data from local storage before displaying the UI
4. WHEN local storage is corrupted or unavailable THEN the app SHALL handle the error gracefully and start with an empty inventory

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the confirmation dialog buttons to work properly when disposing items, so that I can successfully complete the disposal process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I tap the "Confirm Disposal" button THEN the disposal action SHALL be executed
2. WHEN I tap the "Cancel" button THEN the disposal action SHALL be cancelled and dialog dismissed
3. WHEN the disposal is confirmed THEN the items SHALL be removed from my inventory
4. WHEN the disposal is confirmed THEN the dialog SHALL be dismissed automatically
5. WHEN the dialog buttons are tapped THEN they SHALL provide immediate visual feedback

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive points only after successfully disposing items at a bin, so that the scoring system accurately reflects completed disposal actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I pick up an item THEN I SHALL NOT receive points immediately
2. WHEN I successfully dispose an item at a bin THEN I SHALL receive the appropriate points
3. WHEN the disposal is confirmed through the dialog THEN points SHALL be added to my total score
4. WHEN disposal fails or is cancelled THEN no points SHALL be awarded
5. WHEN points are awarded THEN the user SHALL see a visual confirmation of the points gained

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want my stats and values to load properly from local storage, so that my progress and achievements are maintained across app sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app starts THEN user stats SHALL be loaded from local storage
2. WHEN stats are loaded THEN they SHALL be displayed correctly in the UI
3. WHEN local storage contains invalid or corrupted stats data THEN the app SHALL handle it gracefully
4. WHEN stats are updated during gameplay THEN they SHALL be immediately saved to local storage
5. WHEN stats fail to load THEN the app SHALL initialize with default values and log the error
