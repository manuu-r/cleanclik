# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current authentication system in CleanClik is unnecessarily complex with multiple layers of abstraction, redundant state management, complex token handling, and convoluted initialization flows. This feature aims to simplify the entire authentication flow while maintaining security and functionality, making it easier to understand, maintain, and debug.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simplified authentication service that handles all auth operations through a single, clear interface, so that I can easily understand and maintain the authentication logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the authentication system is initialized THEN it SHALL provide a single service class that handles all authentication operations
2. WHEN a user signs in or signs out THEN the system SHALL update authentication state through a single, predictable flow
3. WHEN authentication state changes THEN it SHALL emit clear, consistent state updates without redundant streams
4. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be handled consistently with clear error messages and recovery paths

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want simplified token management that automatically handles token storage and refresh, so that I don't need to manually manage complex token lifecycle operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user authenticates THEN the system SHALL automatically store tokens securely without requiring manual token service calls
2. WHEN tokens need refreshing THEN the system SHALL handle refresh automatically without exposing complex token operations
3. WHEN tokens expire or become invalid THEN the system SHALL automatically clear them and update authentication state
4. WHEN the app starts THEN token restoration SHALL happen transparently without complex session checking logic

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a streamlined user profile management system that integrates seamlessly with authentication, so that user data operations are simple and predictable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user signs in THEN their profile SHALL be loaded or created automatically without separate service calls
2. WHEN user profile data changes THEN it SHALL be updated through simple, direct methods
3. WHEN authentication state changes THEN user profile state SHALL be synchronized automatically
4. WHEN a user signs out THEN all user data SHALL be cleared consistently

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want simplified authentication state management that provides clear, single-source-of-truth state, so that UI components can reliably react to authentication changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication state is needed THEN it SHALL be available through a single, consistent provider
2. WHEN authentication state changes THEN all dependent UI components SHALL receive updates immediately
3. WHEN the app initializes THEN authentication state SHALL be determined quickly without complex loading states
4. WHEN demo mode is active THEN it SHALL work seamlessly without special handling throughout the app

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want simplified error handling and recovery that provides clear feedback and recovery options, so that authentication errors are easy to debug and resolve.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication errors occur THEN they SHALL be categorized clearly with specific error types
2. WHEN network or service errors happen THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate retry mechanisms
3. WHEN initialization fails THEN the system SHALL fall back gracefully to demo mode or clear error states
4. WHEN debugging authentication issues THEN logs SHALL provide clear, actionable information

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the authentication system to require proper Supabase configuration and fail clearly when not configured, so that production authentication is reliable and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Supabase is not properly configured THEN the system SHALL show clear configuration error messages
2. WHEN authentication operations are attempted without proper configuration THEN they SHALL fail with actionable error messages
3. WHEN the app starts without Supabase configuration THEN it SHALL display clear setup instructions
4. WHEN configuration is fixed THEN the authentication system SHALL work immediately without app restart

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want simplified routing and navigation guards that work predictably with authentication state, so that protected routes are handled consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is not authenticated THEN they SHALL be redirected to login automatically
2. WHEN a user authenticates THEN they SHALL be navigated to the appropriate screen without complex routing logic
3. WHEN authentication state is loading THEN appropriate loading states SHALL be shown
4. WHEN authentication errors occur THEN users SHALL see clear error messages with recovery options
