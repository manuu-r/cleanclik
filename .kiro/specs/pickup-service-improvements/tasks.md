# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Fix pickup service detection and inventory integration
  - Lower ML Kit confidence thresholds in ml_detection_service.dart from 0.25 to 0.15 for better object detection
  - Simplify pickup logic in pickup_service.dart by reducing proximity threshold to 100px and confirmation frames to 3
  - Create automatic inventory integration by listening to pickup events and calling InventoryService.addItem()
  - Add comprehensive debug logging for detection events, pickup analysis, and inventory changes
  - Optimize performance by adding frame processing limits and skipping expensive calculations when no hands detected
  - Add real-time UI feedback integration and error handling with retry mechanisms
  - Write integration tests for the complete detection → pickup → inventory flow
