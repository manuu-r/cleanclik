# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The VibeSweep app's object detection system is incorrectly categorizing hands as waste objects, leading to false positive detections and poor user experience. Additionally, the current waste categorization system includes a landfill category that complicates the user experience. This feature will implement hand filtering to prevent hands from being detected as objects and simplify the waste categorization by removing landfill entirely and mapping ML Kit categories directly to the remaining four waste types.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a VibeSweep user, I want hands to not be detected as waste objects, so that I only see actual waste items in the AR overlay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the ML Kit object detection identifies objects THEN the system SHALL filter out any objects that are likely to be hands
2. WHEN hand landmarks are detected by MediaPipe THEN the system SHALL use hand position data to exclude overlapping object detections
3. WHEN object detection confidence is below a threshold for hand-like objects THEN the system SHALL exclude those detections
4. WHEN filtering is applied THEN the system SHALL maintain detection accuracy for actual waste objects

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a VibeSweep user, I want a simplified waste categorization system without landfill, so that I can quickly categorize items into the four main waste types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes ML Kit object categories THEN it SHALL map them to only four waste types: recycle, organic, ewaste, and hazardous
2. WHEN FASHION_GOOD objects are detected THEN the system SHALL categorize them as recycle waste
3. WHEN FOOD objects are detected THEN the system SHALL categorize them as organic waste
4. WHEN HOME_GOOD objects are detected THEN the system SHALL categorize them as recycle waste
5. WHEN PLANT objects are detected THEN the system SHALL categorize them as organic waste
6. WHEN PLACE objects are detected THEN the system SHALL ignore them as they are not waste items

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a VibeSweep user, I want consistent and logical waste categorization, so that I understand which bin to use for each detected object.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN objects are categorized THEN the system SHALL use a clear mapping from ML Kit categories to waste types
2. WHEN multiple objects of the same ML Kit category are detected THEN they SHALL all receive the same waste categorization
3. WHEN the categorization system is updated THEN existing user inventory SHALL remain consistent
4. WHEN users see categorized objects THEN the waste type SHALL be clearly displayed with appropriate visual indicators

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a maintainable object filtering system, so that I can easily adjust filtering rules and categorization mappings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing hand filtering THEN the system SHALL use configurable thresholds and rules
2. WHEN updating waste categorization mappings THEN the system SHALL use a centralized configuration
3. WHEN filtering rules change THEN the system SHALL allow easy testing and validation
4. WHEN debugging object detection THEN the system SHALL provide clear logging of filtering decisions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a VibeSweep user, I want accurate object detection without performance degradation, so that the AR experience remains smooth and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hand filtering is applied THEN the system SHALL maintain the current frame rate performance
2. WHEN processing object detections THEN the filtering SHALL add minimal computational overhead
3. WHEN multiple hands are present THEN the system SHALL efficiently filter all hand-related false positives
4. WHEN the simplified categorization is used THEN object processing SHALL be faster due to reduced complexity
