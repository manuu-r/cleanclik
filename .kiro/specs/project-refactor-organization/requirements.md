# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The CleanClik Flutter project has reached MVP stage but suffers from poor file organization and system design. The current structure has services and widgets scattered without clear categorization, making maintenance and development difficult. This refactor will reorganize the codebase into logical, feature-based modules while maintaining clean architecture principles.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want services organized by functional domain, so that I can quickly locate and maintain related business logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing services THEN the system SHALL group services by functional domains (auth, camera, inventory, location, social, etc.)
2. WHEN creating service directories THEN each directory SHALL contain only services related to that specific domain
3. WHEN moving services THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing functionality and imports
4. WHEN organizing services THEN the system SHALL create clear separation between core services and feature-specific services

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want widgets organized by feature and usage pattern, so that I can efficiently build and maintain UI components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing widgets THEN the system SHALL group widgets by feature domain (camera, map, inventory, social, etc.)
2. WHEN creating widget directories THEN each directory SHALL contain widgets specific to that feature
3. WHEN organizing common widgets THEN the system SHALL place reusable components in a shared directory
4. WHEN organizing overlay widgets THEN the system SHALL group all overlay-related components together
5. WHEN moving widgets THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing widget functionality and styling

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clear directory structure that follows Flutter best practices, so that new team members can quickly understand the codebase organization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating the new structure THEN the system SHALL follow clean architecture principles
2. WHEN organizing directories THEN the system SHALL use consistent naming conventions (snake_case for files, feature-based for directories)
3. WHEN structuring features THEN each feature SHALL have its own directory with services, widgets, and screens co-located
4. WHEN organizing shared components THEN the system SHALL clearly separate shared/common code from feature-specific code

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want services categorized by their primary responsibility, so that I can understand system boundaries and dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN categorizing services THEN authentication services SHALL be grouped together
2. WHEN categorizing services THEN camera and AR services SHALL be grouped together  
3. WHEN categorizing services THEN database and storage services SHALL be grouped together
4. WHEN categorizing services THEN location and mapping services SHALL be grouped together
5. WHEN categorizing services THEN social and sharing services SHALL be grouped together
6. WHEN categorizing services THEN platform-specific services SHALL be clearly identified

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want widgets categorized by their UI purpose and feature domain, so that I can build consistent user interfaces efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN categorizing widgets THEN camera-related widgets SHALL be grouped together
2. WHEN categorizing widgets THEN map-related widgets SHALL be grouped together
3. WHEN categorizing widgets THEN overlay widgets SHALL be grouped together
4. WHEN categorizing widgets THEN common/shared widgets SHALL be in a dedicated directory
5. WHEN categorizing widgets THEN animation widgets SHALL be grouped together
6. WHEN categorizing widgets THEN debug widgets SHALL be grouped together

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the file movement process to be safe and non-destructive, so that no existing functionality is broken during reorganization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN moving files THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing file contents exactly
2. WHEN moving files THEN the system SHALL not modify any code logic or functionality
3. WHEN moving files THEN the system SHALL only change file locations and directory structure
4. WHEN moving files THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing import statements initially
5. WHEN completing the reorganization THEN all files SHALL be in their new locations without any code changes
