# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The bin feedback overlay system currently fails to display properly after QR code scanning due to Flutter widget lifecycle issues. When a user scans a QR code for a bin, the system should show a feedback overlay indicating the match result, but instead it crashes and falls back to AR detection mode. This prevents users from seeing important feedback about their bin interactions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user scanning a QR code on a bin, I want to see immediate visual feedback about the scan result, so that I understand whether I can dispose items in this bin.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a QR code is successfully scanned and parsed THEN the system SHALL display a bin feedback overlay within 500ms
2. WHEN the overlay is displayed THEN it SHALL show the bin category, match type, and disposal status clearly
3. WHEN the user has no items in inventory THEN the overlay SHALL indicate "Empty Inventory" status
4. WHEN the overlay appears THEN it SHALL not cause any Flutter widget lifecycle errors
5. WHEN the overlay is shown THEN the camera preview SHALL remain visible in the background

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user interacting with the bin feedback overlay, I want smooth animations and proper theming, so that the experience feels polished and consistent with the app design.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the overlay appears THEN it SHALL animate smoothly using proper Material 3 theming
2. WHEN the overlay initializes THEN it SHALL not access Theme.of() or other inherited widgets in initState()
3. WHEN animations are created THEN they SHALL be initialized in didChangeDependencies() or build() methods
4. WHEN the overlay is displayed THEN it SHALL use consistent colors and typography from the app theme
5. WHEN the overlay transitions THEN all animations SHALL complete without errors

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the overlay system, I want proper error handling and fallback behavior, so that overlay failures don't break the entire camera flow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN overlay initialization fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue with camera operation
2. WHEN Theme.of() or similar calls fail THEN the overlay SHALL use default styling as fallback
3. WHEN animation controllers fail to initialize THEN the overlay SHALL display without animations
4. WHEN the overlay widget throws an exception THEN the camera SHALL remain functional
5. WHEN overlay errors occur THEN they SHALL be captured and reported for debugging

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user who has scanned a bin QR code, I want the overlay to automatically dismiss after showing the information, so that I can continue using the camera without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the bin feedback overlay is displayed THEN it SHALL automatically dismiss after 3-5 seconds
2. WHEN the overlay is dismissed THEN the camera SHALL return to the appropriate mode (AR or QR scanning)
3. WHEN the user taps outside the overlay THEN it SHALL dismiss immediately
4. WHEN the overlay dismisses THEN all animation controllers SHALL be properly disposed
5. WHEN returning to camera mode THEN the previous camera state SHALL be restored correctly
