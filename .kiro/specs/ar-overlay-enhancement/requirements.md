# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the current AR experience in CleanClik by replacing basic bounding boxes and skeleton overlays with stylized, gamified visual elements. The enhancement focuses on creating engaging trash bin overlays with animated highlights and interactive hand overlays with gesture feedback, all designed to improve user engagement and maintain the eco-friendly aesthetic while adding gamification energy.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a CleanClik user, I want to see stylized, colorful trash bins instead of plain bounding boxes when objects are detected, so that the AR experience feels more engaging and game-like.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an object is detected THEN the system SHALL display a stylized trash bin overlay instead of a bounding box
2. WHEN a trash category is identified THEN the system SHALL show the appropriate bin type with category-specific colors and icons
3. WHEN trash is detected THEN the system SHALL display animated highlights or glowing edges around interactable bins
4. WHEN trash detection occurs THEN the system SHALL use earth-tone colors (greens, blues) with brighter accent colors for gamification elements
5. WHEN multiple objects are detected THEN each SHALL have its own appropriately styled bin overlay

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a CleanClik user, I want to see fun particle effects and animations when trash is detected or picked up, so that the interaction feels rewarding and magical.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN trash is detected THEN the system SHALL trigger sparkling clean light bursts or animated effects
2. WHEN trash is picked up THEN the system SHALL display animated recycling icons or celebration particles
3. WHEN trash categories are shown THEN the system SHALL display playful cartoonish or pixel-art style icons
4. WHEN particle effects are displayed THEN they SHALL use colors consistent with the eco-friendly theme
5. WHEN animations play THEN they SHALL complete within 2 seconds to maintain performance

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a CleanClik user, I want to see integrated progress bars, points, and score counters as part of the AR overlay, so that I can track my progress without looking away from the camera view.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN trash bins are displayed THEN the system SHALL show integrated progress bars or score counters
2. WHEN points are earned THEN the system SHALL display floating UI elements near the trash bin
3. WHEN score updates occur THEN the system SHALL animate the counter changes smoothly
4. WHEN multiple UI elements are shown THEN they SHALL not overlap or obstruct the main AR view
5. WHEN UI elements are displayed THEN they SHALL maintain readability in various lighting conditions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a CleanClik user, I want to see stylized hand silhouettes instead of skeleton overlays when my hands are tracked, so that the hand tracking feels more polished and integrated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hands are detected THEN the system SHALL display stylized, semi-transparent hand silhouettes
2. WHEN hand tracking is active THEN the system SHALL show glowing or pulsing outlines
3. WHEN hands are tracked THEN the system SHALL use colors consistent with trash overlays
4. WHEN hand overlays are shown THEN they SHALL have subtle gradient shifts or neon outlines for differentiation
5. WHEN hands move THEN the overlay SHALL update smoothly at 30fps minimum

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a CleanClik user, I want to see animated gesture hints and interactive feedback when I perform actions with my hands, so that I understand what gestures are available and get confirmation of my actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hands are detected THEN the system SHALL show animated gesture hints like finger taps or grabs
2. WHEN valid gestures are available THEN the system SHALL display pointing or interaction indicators
3. WHEN gestures are performed THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback
4. WHEN gesture hints are shown THEN they SHALL appear next to detected hands without obstruction
5. WHEN multiple gesture options exist THEN the system SHALL prioritize the most relevant hint

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a CleanClik user, I want to see magical trail effects and particle animations following my fingertips, so that hand interactions feel dynamic and engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fingertips are tracked THEN the system SHALL display interactive trail effects
2. WHEN fingers move THEN the system SHALL show sparkling particles following fingertips
3. WHEN trail effects are active THEN they SHALL fade naturally over 1-2 seconds
4. WHEN multiple fingers are tracked THEN each SHALL have its own trail effect
5. WHEN performance is impacted THEN the system SHALL reduce particle density while maintaining visual appeal

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a CleanClik user, I want to see special effects when I "grasp" virtual trash items with my hands, so that the pickup action feels satisfying and rewarding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a hand grasps a virtual trash item THEN the system SHALL change the hand color or trigger grab effects
2. WHEN pickup actions occur THEN the system SHALL display "grab sparkle" or "pickup swoosh" animations
3. WHEN grasp gestures are detected THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual confirmation
4. WHEN pickup effects play THEN they SHALL complete within 1 second for responsive feedback
5. WHEN grasp actions fail THEN the system SHALL provide subtle feedback indicating the miss

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a CleanClik user, I want all AR overlays to maintain consistent visual design and performance, so that the experience feels cohesive and runs smoothly on my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any overlay is displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain the eco-friendly color palette
2. WHEN multiple overlay types are shown THEN they SHALL use consistent design language
3. WHEN overlays are rendered THEN the system SHALL maintain 30fps minimum performance
4. WHEN device resources are limited THEN the system SHALL gracefully reduce overlay complexity
5. WHEN overlays are active THEN they SHALL not interfere with object detection accuracy
