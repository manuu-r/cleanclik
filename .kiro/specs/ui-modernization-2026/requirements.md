# UI Modernization 2026 - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on modernizing the CleanClik app's user interface to be more relevant for 2026 while maintaining the AR-first design philosophy. The improvements include enhancing transparency/opacity levels, consolidating camera scanning options, modernizing authentication screens, removing non-functional elements, and implementing subtle Material 3 expressive design improvements.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Transparency and Opacity Enhancement

**User Story:** As a user, I want UI elements to be more visible and readable, so that I can easily interact with the interface without straining to see content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing glassmorphism containers THEN the opacity SHALL be increased from 0.15 to 0.25-0.35 for better visibility
2. WHEN viewing overlay elements THEN they SHALL have sufficient contrast against the background
3. WHEN using the app in different lighting conditions THEN UI elements SHALL remain clearly visible
4. WHEN interacting with buttons and controls THEN they SHALL have adequate visual feedback

### Requirement 2: Camera Scanning Consolidation

**User Story:** As a user, I want a single, prominent way to access camera scanning, so that I'm not confused by multiple similar options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the home screen THEN there SHALL be only one primary camera scanning entry point
2. WHEN the camera scanning button is displayed THEN it SHALL be prominently featured and visually appealing
3. WHEN accessing camera functionality THEN the user SHALL have clear options for different scanning modes (object detection vs QR code)
4. WHEN removing duplicate camera options THEN the most intuitive placement SHALL be retained

### Requirement 3: Authentication Screen Modernization

**User Story:** As a user, I want modern, visually appealing authentication screens that match the app's AR theme, so that my first impression of the app is positive and cohesive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing login/signup screens THEN they SHALL use the AR theme colors and glassmorphism design
2. WHEN interacting with form fields THEN they SHALL have modern Material 3 styling with proper focus states
3. WHEN viewing authentication screens THEN they SHALL include subtle animations and breathing effects
4. WHEN using social login options THEN they SHALL be styled consistently with the app theme
5. WHEN viewing the app logo and branding THEN it SHALL use neon gradient effects matching the AR theme

### Requirement 4: Non-functional Element Removal

**User Story:** As a user, I want all buttons and interactive elements to work as expected, so that I don't encounter frustrating dead-ends in the interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN encountering interactive elements THEN they SHALL either function properly or be removed
2. WHEN buttons are identified as non-functional THEN they SHALL be removed from the interface
3. WHEN placeholder functionality exists THEN it SHALL either be implemented or removed
4. WHEN navigation elements are present THEN they SHALL lead to functional destinations

### Requirement 5: Material 3 Expressive Design Implementation

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to feel modern and current with 2026 design trends, so that the interface feels fresh and up-to-date.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing UI components THEN they SHALL use Material 3 expressive design principles
2. WHEN interacting with buttons THEN they SHALL have subtle micro-animations and state changes
3. WHEN viewing loading states THEN they SHALL use modern progress indicators
4. WHEN using the app THEN animations SHALL be smooth and purposeful
5. WHEN viewing typography THEN it SHALL follow Material 3 type scale with proper hierarchy
6. WHEN viewing colors THEN they SHALL use the updated neon color palette with proper contrast ratios

### Requirement 6: DRY Code Refactoring (Implemented During UI Improvements)

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the UI code to follow DRY principles while implementing the modernization, so that the codebase becomes more maintainable and consistent through the improvement process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN enhancing existing UI components THEN duplicate code SHALL be identified and extracted into reusable widgets
2. WHEN updating styling THEN common patterns SHALL be centralized in theme files and reusable components
3. WHEN implementing new animations THEN existing animation widgets SHALL be enhanced and reused
4. WHEN modernizing UI elements THEN they SHALL leverage and improve the existing design system
5. WHEN applying improvements THEN changes SHALL be consistently applied across similar components throughout the app
6. WHEN refactoring code THEN the improvements SHALL maintain existing functionality while enhancing maintainability
