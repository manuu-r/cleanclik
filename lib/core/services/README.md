# AR Detection System

This directory contains the core AR detection system for CleanCity Vibe, implementing real-time object detection with colored AR overlays.

## Components

### ARDetectionService
- **Purpose**: Main service for AR-based object detection and overlay rendering
- **Key Features**:
  - Real-time ML Kit object detection
  - Category-based color mapping
  - Performance optimization for <200ms latency
  - Graceful fallback for devices without AR capability

### ObjectTracker
- **Purpose**: Manages object tracking IDs and persistence across frames
- **Key Features**:
  - Unique tracking ID assignment
  - Object overlap detection and ID reuse
  - Automatic cleanup of expired objects
  - Smooth visual transitions

### CameraService
- **Purpose**: Camera initialization and permission handling
- **Key Features**:
  - Permission management
  - Camera selection (back/front)
  - Error handling and fallbacks

## Waste Categories

The system categorizes detected objects into 5 disposal categories:

1. **EcoGems** (Green) - Recyclable items
   - Bottles, cans, plastic containers, paper, cardboard
2. **FuelShards** (Light Green) - Organic waste
   - Food scraps, fruits, vegetables, compostable materials
3. **VoidCrystals** (Gray) - Landfill waste
   - General trash, non-recyclable items
4. **TechRelics** (Blue) - Electronic waste
   - Phones, computers, batteries, cables
5. **ToxicOrbs** (Red) - Hazardous materials
   - Chemicals, paint, oil, pharmaceuticals

## Performance Optimizations

- **Detection Interval**: 100ms between ML Kit processing calls
- **Confidence Threshold**: 0.5 minimum for object classification
- **Frame Processing**: Asynchronous with processing flags to prevent overlap
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of expired tracking objects
- **Battery Optimization**: Efficient camera preview and detection cycles

## Usage Example

```dart
// Initialize AR detection service
final arService = ARDetectionServiceImpl();

// Start detection with camera controller
await arService.startDetection(cameraController);

// Listen to detection stream
arService.detectionStream.listen((detectedObjects) {
  // Update UI with detected objects
  setState(() {
    _detectedObjects = detectedObjects;
  });
});

// Stop detection when done
await arService.stopDetection();
arService.dispose();
```

## Testing

Run the AR detection tests:
```bash
flutter test test/ar_detection_test.dart
```

Tests cover:
- Waste category classification
- Object tracking ID management
- Overlap detection and ID reuse
- Object lifecycle management

## Requirements Satisfied

This implementation satisfies the following requirements from the spec:

- **1.1**: Real-time object detection at â‰¥15fps on mid-range devices
- **1.2**: Colored AR overlays within 200ms indicating bin categories
- **1.3**: Simultaneous multi-object tagging with distinct tracking IDs
- **1.4**: LLM-assisted classification hints (framework ready)

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with LLM for low-confidence object classification
- ARCore/ARKit depth API integration for realistic occlusion
- Advanced tracking algorithms for improved object persistence
- Performance profiling and optimization for various device tiers
