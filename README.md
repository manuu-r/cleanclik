# CleanClik

An AR-powered mobile application that gamifies urban cleanup through real-time object detection, tracking, and reward systems.

## üåü Features

- **AR Object Detection**: Real-time trash detection with colored overlays
- **Gamified Cleanup**: Points, streaks, and leaderboards
- **Interactive Map**: Bin locations and cleanup hotspots
- **Social Competition**: Leaderboards and achievements
- **Environmental Impact**: Track your contribution to city cleanliness

## üèóÔ∏è Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Task 1: Project Foundation and Core Navigation (COMPLETED)

- ‚úÖ Flutter project with iOS and Android support
- ‚úÖ Core dependencies added:
  - `go_router` for navigation
  - `flutter_riverpod` for state management
  - `camera` for AR capabilities
  - `permission_handler` for permissions
  - `google_maps_flutter` for mapping
  - `geolocator` for location services
- ‚úÖ Camera and location permissions configured for both platforms
- ‚úÖ Complete navigation shell with 5 main routes:
  - Home: Welcome screen with stats and category guide
  - Camera: AR scanner interface (placeholder)
  - Map: Interactive cleanup map (placeholder)
  - Leaderboard: Competition rankings with time periods
  - Profile: User stats and achievements
- ‚úÖ Environmental color scheme with Material 3 design
- ‚úÖ Routing structure with proper state management
- ‚úÖ Basic UI screens with consistent styling and placeholder content

## üé® Design System

### Color Scheme
- **EcoGems** (Recycle): Green `#4CAF50`
- **FuelShards** (Organic): Blue `#2196F3`
- **VoidDust** (Landfill): Gray `#757575`
- **SparkCores** (E-waste): Orange `#FF9800`
- **ToxicCrystals** (Hazardous): Red `#E91E63`

### Architecture
- **Framework**: Flutter with Dart
- **State Management**: Riverpod
- **Navigation**: go_router with StatefulShellRoute
- **Theme**: Material 3 with custom environmental colors
- **Permissions**: Handled for both iOS and Android

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (>=3.24.0)
- Dart SDK (^3.9.0)
